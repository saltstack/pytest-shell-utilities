Remove the redundant `wheel` dependency from pyproject.toml.

The setuptools backend takes care of adding it automatically
via `setuptools.build_meta.get_requires_for_build_wheel()` since day
one.  The documentation has historically been wrong about listing it,
and it has been fixed since.

See https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/commit/f7d30a9529378cf69054b5176249e5457aaf640a
